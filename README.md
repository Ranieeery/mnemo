# Mnemo: Local Video Library (AI-Generated & User-Enhanced)

**This project was originally generated by advanced AI models (Claude Sonnet 3.7, Claude Sonnet 4, GPT 4.1, and GPT 5) and has been further customized and improved by the project owner.**

## What is Mnemo?

Mnemo is a desktop application for managing and exploring your local video collection. Unlike traditional media servers, Mnemo is designed to organize and navigate your library based on your actual folder and subfolder structure, just like a file explorer. This approach gives you full control and transparency over your video organization.

## Key Features

- **Folder-Based Navigation:** Add root directories and browse your videos by folder hierarchy.
- **Modern UI:** Responsive interface with sidebar navigation, dark mode by default, and Tailwind CSS styling.
- **Metadata & Thumbnails:** Automatically scans folders, extracts video metadata (duration, title, etc.), and generates thumbnails using ffmpeg/ffprobe.
- **SQLite Database:** Stores video metadata and tags for fast searching and organization.
- **Tagging System:** Add and manage tags for your videos, improving search and categorization.
- **Search:** Quickly find videos by title or tags.
- **Import/Export:** Backup or restore your library with JSON import/export.
- **Settings & Customization:** User settings and library management tools.
- **Unit & Integration Tests:** Critical backend logic is covered by automated tests (Vitest).

## Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Tauri (Rust backend, secure desktop apps)
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Database:** SQLite (via tauri-plugin-sql)
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Package Manager:** Bun

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   bun install
   ```

2. **Run in development mode:**

   ```sh
   bun tauri dev
   ```

3. **Build for production:**

   ```sh
   bun tauri build
   ```

## Development Process

This project was created iteratively, following strict best practices for stability and code quality. Each feature was implemented and tested step-by-step, with immediate fixes for any errors. The AI provided the initial architecture and code, while the project owner (me) made significant manual improvements and customizations.
