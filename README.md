## What is Mnemo?

Mnemo is a desktop application for managing and exploring your local video collection. Unlike traditional media servers, Mnemo is designed to organize and navigate your library based on your actual folder and subfolder structure, just like a file explorer. This approach gives you full control and transparency over your video organization.

## Key Features

- **Folder-Based Navigation:** Add root directories and browse your videos by folder hierarchy
- **Tag Management System:** Comprehensive tag management with modal interface, bulk operations (add/remove tags from folders), suggested tags, and tag count indicators
- **Custom Folder Icons:** Personalize folders with 70+ emoji presets or custom emojis, persistent across sessions with real-time updates
- **Enhanced Context Menus:** Folder operations (mark all as watched/unwatched, add/remove tags), library folder customization (change icons)
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Backspace (reset speed to 1x), Arrow Up/Down (adjust speed Â±0.25x), Alt+Arrows (navigate videos), Space (play/pause), F (fullscreen), M (mute)
- **Modern UI:** Responsive interface with sidebar navigation, dark mode, custom modals with backdrop blur, mobile-optimized touch controls
- **Metadata & Thumbnails:** Automatically scans folders, extracts video metadata (duration, title, etc.), and generates thumbnails using ffmpeg/ffprobe
- **SQLite Database:** Stores video metadata, tags, custom icons, and settings for fast searching and organization
- **Search & Filtering:** Quick search by title or tags with real-time results
- **Import/Export:** Backup or restore your entire library with JSON import/export
- **Settings & Tools:** Comprehensive settings panel with library management, tag management modal, and database debug tools

## Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Tauri (Rust backend, secure desktop apps)
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Database:** SQLite (via tauri-plugin-sql)
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Package Manager:** Bun

## Getting Started

### 1. Download (Recommended)

Grab the latest prebuilt installers/binaries from the **Releases** page:

<https://github.com/Ranieeery/mnemo/releases>

> NOTE: For now, published binaries are Windows-only. macOS and Linux packages will be added in future releases. You can still build from source on those platforms (see below).

Available targets (as published):

- Windows: `.exe` (NSIS) and/or `.msi`

After download:

- Windows: run the installer

### 2. Run From Source (Development)

Prerequisites: Bun, Rust toolchain, Node build deps, and (for Linux) GTK/WebKit deps.

Install deps:

```sh
bun install
```

Start dev:

```sh
bun tauri dev
```

### 3. Build Locally

```sh
bun tauri build
```

Artifacts will appear under:
`src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`

Platform notes:

- macOS: build on macOS for signed/notarized DMG (optional signing not yet enabled).
- Linux: build on a Linux host (or CI) to produce `.deb` & `.AppImage`.

### Code Formatting

This project uses Prettier for consistent code formatting.

Format all files:

```sh
bun run format
```

Check formatting without making changes:

```sh
bun run format:check
```

The VS Code settings are configured to format on save automatically when the Prettier extension is installed.

## Development Process

This project was created iteratively, following strict best practices for stability and code quality. Each feature was implemented and tested step-by-step, with immediate fixes for any errors. The AI provided the initial architecture and code, while the project owner (me) made significant manual improvements and customizations.
